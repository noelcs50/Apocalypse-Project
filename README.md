My Apocalypse project! Heaven or Hell... you decide! Hope you enjoy :) 

Project Deployed Here: https://vercel.com/noelcs50s-projects/apocalypse-project 


The main portion of my project is found within the "src" folder under the "App.jsx" file! 

**Quick rundown of how to play: **

1. click the screen,
2. Then turn 180 degrees if you spawn in looking at a white orb
3. use AWSD to move around and make a decision based on the scenario (walk a good bit past the option to make sure the game picks up on your decision, you'll be loaded into another hallway with a new scenario once you make a decision)
4. Do the previous step 2 more times
5. Accept your fate and see what you did right / wrong :D / :(
6. Press enter to play again
7. Press esc to exit game!
